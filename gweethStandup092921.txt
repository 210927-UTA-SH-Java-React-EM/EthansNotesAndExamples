We established team 2 as GWEETH (an acronym of our names) on September 29th.
I'm scrum master based on a random number generator.

Gonzalo is doing very well, done with almost all of the activities.
The rest of us expressed concerns about having limited GIT experience and trying to get our Java projects to pass their tests.
